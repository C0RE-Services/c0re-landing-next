              <p>
                C0RE Focus provides tools for tracking focus and related
                activity and may generate AI-powered responses using third-party
                services.
              </p>

              <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

              <h2>6. AI Features Disclaimer</h2>
              <p>
                AI-generated responses are created automatically and may be
                inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate.
              </p>

                C0RE Focus does not provide medical, legal, financial, or other

              <h2>7. Reporting and Blocking</h2>
              <p>
                The App may allow users to report and block others. We may
                review reports and take action at our discretion to protect

                We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of
                the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
